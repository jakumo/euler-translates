<h2>About... Roman Numerals</h2>
<h3>How do you read and write Roman numerals?</h3>
<br>

<p>Traditional Roman numerals are made up of the following denominations:</p>
<p style="margin-left:100px;font-family:courier new,monospace;">I = 1<br>
V = 5<br>
X = 10<br>
L = 50<br>
C = 100<br>
D = 500<br>
M = 1000</p>
<p>In order for a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are three basic rules which must be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Numerals must be arranged in descending order of size.</b><br>
<b><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">M</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">C</span>, and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span> cannot be equalled or exceeded by smaller denominations.</b><br>
<b><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">D</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">L</span>, and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">V</span> can each only appear once.</b></p>
<p>For example, the number sixteen could be written as <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XVI</span> or <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIIIIII</span>, with the first being the preferred form as it uses the least number of numerals. We could not write <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII</span> because we are making <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span> (ten) from smaller denominations, nor could we write <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">VVVI</span> because the second and third rule are being broken.</p>
<p>The "descending size" rule was introduced to allow the use of subtractive combinations. For example, four can be written <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IV</span> because it is one before five. As the rule requires that the numerals be arranged in order of size it should be clear to a reader that the presence of a smaller numeral out of place, so to speak, was unambiguously to be subtracted from the following numeral rather than added.</p>
<p>For example, nineteen could be written <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIX</span> = <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span> (ten) + <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IX</span> (nine). Note also how the rule requires <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span> (ten) be placed before <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IX</span> (nine), and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IXX</span> would not be an acceptable configuration (descending size rule). Similarly, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XVIV</span> would be invalid because <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">V</span> can only appear once in a number.</p>
<p>Generally the Romans tried to use as few numerals as possible when displaying numbers. For this reason, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIX</span> would be the preferred form of nineteen over other valid combinations, like <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIIIIIIIII</span> or <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XVIIII</span>.</p>
<p>By mediaeval times it had become standard practice to avoid more than three consecutive identical numerals by taking advantage of the more compact subtractive combinations. That is, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IV</span> would be written instead of <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIII</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IX</span> would be used instead of <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIIIIIII</span> or <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">VIIII</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition to the three rules given above, if subtractive combinations are used then the following four rules must be followed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>Only one <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">I</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span>, and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">C</span> can be used as the leading numeral in part of a subtractive pair.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">I</span> can only be placed before <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">V</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span>.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">X</span> can only be placed before <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">L</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">C</span>.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">C</span> can only be placed before <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">D</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">M</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which means that <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IL</span> would be considered to be an invalid way of writing forty-nine, and whereas <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XXXXIIIIIIIII</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XXXXVIIII</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XXXXIX</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XLIIIIIIIII</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XLVIIII</span>, and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XLIX</span> are all quite legitimate, the latter is the preferred (minimal) form. However, minimal form was not a rule and there still remain in Rome many examples where economy of numerals has not been employed. For example, in the famous Colosseum the numerals above the forty-ninth entrance is written <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XXXXVIIII</span> rather than <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XLIX</span>.</p>
<p>It is also expected, but not required, that higher denominations should be used whenever possible; for example, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">V</span> should be used in place of <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIII</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">L</span> should be used in place of <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XXXXX</span>, and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">D</span> should be used in place of <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">CCCCC</span>. However, in the church of Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura (St Agnes' outside the walls), found in Rome, the date, <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">MCCCCCCVI</span> (1606), is written on the gilded and coffered wooden ceiling; I am sure that many would argue that it should have been written <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">MDCVI</span>.</p>
<p>So if we believe the adage, "when in Rome do as the Romans do," and we see how the Romans write numerals, then it clearly gives us much more freedom than many would care to admit.</p>
